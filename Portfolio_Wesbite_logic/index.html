                    My professional Career started at CiCi's Pizza where I worked as a Cook. 
                    Quickly becoming an Assistant Manager after 2 months employed. 
                    During my time as a cook and manager, I learned quickly the importance of teamwork under stressful timelines 
                    and the ability to manage multiple people to achieve a common goal.
                    The greatest professional development I acquired from this position was,
                    how to speak to clients in a way to answer all questions and eliminate any risk of miscommunications.
                    From which assisted me in starting and excelling in The United States Army. I joined the Army in November of 2016
                    and served until August of 2021. My military experience sets me apart from other employees, as during this time I learned countless leadership
                    qualities, skills, attributes and the ability to express compassion within a professional threshold. I attained the rank of Sergeant and title of 
                    'FSC Maintenance Control Squad Leader'. During my last year of Service I managed a squad the size of 9 Soldiers, to ensure Mission Readiness of more then 150 vehicles, 
                    weapons, and safety equipment worth more then $200 million. My greatest achievement in this time was during a field exercise, when more then 85% of my company 
                    were unavailable due to a internal COVID-19 outbreak leaving myself in charge along with 5 other Soldiers from different Squads. I managed to successfully manage my team and maintain readiness 
                    of 200+ Battalion Vehicles, and 600+ Battalion Weapons during a 14 day training period. Now I am a aspiring Software Developer, looking to work with a great team and 
                    learn something new <b>everyday</b>.

                    In my Professional life, my priorities are God, Family then Country. Friday Sunset to Saturday Sunset, I will not work as it is 
                    my time with The Lord for Sabbath Observance. I enjoy gaming periodically where I have time, but I get my gratification in Life taking care of my Family.
                    I do not have many hobbies, if any at all, though I do enjoy taking things apart and putting them back together. Engines to be specific. If I had the chance I would be doing 
                    that on the side to help the people around me. I spend my weekends volunteering wherever I can find an opening. I am also capable of both, extreme professionalism and 
                    extreme 'goof-ball-ism', giving me the ability to be an effect Leader to a Team while also ensuring comradery and motivation stays elevated.
